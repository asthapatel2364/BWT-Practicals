    <p> It is the study or use of computers, telecommunication systems and other devices to create, process, store,
        retrieve and transmit information. While the term is commonly used to refer to computers and computer
        networks, it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones.
        Information technology is an application of computer science and computer engineering. An information technology
        system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking,
        a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of
        IT users, and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system. IT
        systems play a vital role in facilitating efficient data management, enhancing communication networks, and
        supporting organizational processes across various industries. Successful IT projects require meticulous
        planning and ongoing maintenance to ensure optimal functionality and alignment with organizational
        objectives.


        Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, analysing and communicating information since the
        earliest writing systems were developed,[4] the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared
        in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler
        commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information
        technology (IT)."Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application
        of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through
        computer programs.Information technology (IT) is the study or use of computers, telecommunication systems and
        other devices to create, process, store, retrieve and transmit information.[1] While the term is commonly used
        to refer to computers and computer networks, it also encompasses other information distribution technologies
        such as television and telephones. Information technology is an application of computer science and computer
        engineering.

        <h2>Human Robot</h2>
    </section>


    <p> A humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such
        as interacting with human tools and environments and working alongside humans, for experimental purposes, such
        as the study of bipedal locomotion,[2] or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head,
        two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body. Androids are humanoid
        robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.The concept of a humanoid robot originated in many different
        cultures around the world. Some of the earliest
        accounts of the idea of humanoid automata date to the 4th century BCE in Greek mythologies and various religious
        and philosophical texts from China. Physical prototypes of humanoid automata were later created in the Middle
        East, Italy, Japan, France and South Korea.GreeceThe Greek god of blacksmiths, Hephaestus, created several
        different humanoid automata in various myths. In Homer's Iliad, Hephaestus created golden handmaidens and imbued
        them with human-like voices to serve as speaking tools or instruments.[3] Another Greek myth details how
        Hephaestus crafted a giant bronze automaton named Talos to protect the island of Crete from invaders.[4China
        In the 3rd century BCE, a Taoist philosophical text called the Liezi, written by Chinese philosopher Lie Yukou,
        detailed the idea of a humanoid automaton. The text includes mention of an engineer named Yan Shi who created a
        life-size, human-like robot for the fifth king of the Chinese Zhou Dynasty, King Mu.[5] The robot was primarily
        constructed of leather and wood. It was capable of walking, singing, and moving all parts of its body.[5]Middle
        East
        In the 13th century, a Muslim engineer named Ismail al-Jazari designed various humanoid automata. He created a
        waitress robot that would dispense drinks from a liquid reservoir and appear out of an automatic door to serve
        them.[6] Another automaton he created was used for hand washing to refill a basin with water after being
        drained.[7]

        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    </section>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
        cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from
        users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.Implementing effective cybersecurity
        measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices
        than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative;.A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers
        of protection spread across the computers, networks,
        programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system
        can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection,
        investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an
        effective defense from cyberattacks.Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy
        security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data.
        Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles from these Top 10 Cyber Organizations must have a framework for
        how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks. One
        well-respected model, the NIST cybersecurity framework, can guide you. It explains how you can identify attacks,
        protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks.
        Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect
        themselves from cyberattacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart
        devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include
        next-generation firewalls, Domain Name System (DNS) filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, and email
        security solutions.In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an
        individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to
        the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants,
        hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our
        society functioning.Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat
        researchers at
        Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities,
        educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. Their work makes the
        internet safer for everyone.Cloud security provides rapid threat detection and remediation, enhancing visibility
        and intelligence to prevent malware impacts. It delivers robust protection in multicloud environments,
        streamlining security without affecting user productivity, and is essential for the safety of applications,
        data, and users in both hybrid and remote work settings. The scalable nature of cloud security allows for the
        defense of an expanding array of users, devices, and cloud applications, ensuring comprehensive coverage across
        all points of potential attack.
